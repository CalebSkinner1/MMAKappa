This project is part of the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org). The SCORE Network's aim is to create interactive modules that teach students statistics using data from sports.
The SCORE Network uses ISLE, an interactive platform, to publish their work. Initially, however, projects are written as rmd files and reviewed as pdfs.
This project holds the rough draft of one such module that I wrote during the summer of 2023. This module explains the statistical concept of Inter-rater reliability using data
from Mixed Martial Arts judges. Overall, the module covers Percent Agreement, Cohen's Kappa, Weighted Kappa, and Fleiss' Kappa. In the future, this module will be published on the SCORE Network.

## Data
This file holds decisions.csv, the file used in the analysis. This data set includes fighters, judges, and decisions made in thousands of MMA fights since 1995.

## ISLE Conversions
This folder holds the conversions needed to convert the data into ISLE format.

## Data Analysis
The Data Analysis file is the rough draft of the module. It explains Inter-Rater-Reliability and provides the basis for the interaction used in ISLE.
